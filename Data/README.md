# Minecraft data

This repository will hold simple lists of data for people to freely use. They will be updated for the latest Minecraft Java Edition snapshot.

Elements in the list can have parentheses around them, indicating they are slightly different from the bulk of the elements. This can mean those elements can not be used everywhere the other elements can.
