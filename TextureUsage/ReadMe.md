A program used to generate a list of Minecraft textures which are used in Minecraft block model files. It will include the amount of and in which block models the texture is used.

Simple launch the program in ".../assets/minecraft/models/block" of an unpacked Minecraft version jar.

When running from the commandline a lower limit can be specified to exclude textures which are used in equal or less model files.
